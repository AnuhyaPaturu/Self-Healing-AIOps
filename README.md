An AI-driven system that observes, detects, and heals infrastructure anomalies.

🌟 Project Overview
This platform is a Closed-Loop AIOps engine designed to reduce system downtime and manual intervention. It integrates real-time monitoring with Machine Learning to identify "invisible" system failures and automatically execute remediation scripts to restore health.

🚀 Key Features
Real-Time Observability: Latency-free monitoring via Prometheus and Node Exporter.

Machine Learning Brain: Uses an Isolation Forest (Unsupervised Learning) model to detect behavioral anomalies without predefined thresholds.

Confidence-Gated Remediation: AI only triggers "healing" when its confidence score exceeds a safety threshold (e.g., 85%).

FinOps ROI Tracker: A real-time dashboard tracking the estimated cost savings generated by automated incident resolution.

Precision Healing: A Python-based engine that identifies the specific high-CPU PID (Process ID) and terminates it, ensuring minimal system disruption.

🏗️ Technical Architecture
The system follows a standard OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) architecture:

Observe: Metrics are scraped from the host machine using Prometheus.

Orient: Data is processed in Python and normalized for Machine Learning.

Decide: The Isolation Forest algorithm calculates an anomaly score and a confidence percentage.

Act: The Remediation Engine (psutil) executes a precision kill of the offending process.

🧠 The "Why" (Engineering Decisions)
Why Isolation Forest? Unlike simple "If CPU > 90%" rules, this AI learns your unique system baseline. It can detect a "frozen" app at 30% CPU if that behavior is statistically abnormal for your environment.

Explainable AI (XAI): The dashboard displays a Confidence Score, moving the system from a "Black Box" to a transparent, trustworthy tool.

Safety Gate: Implementation of a Human-in-the-Loop threshold ensures that the AI doesn't act on "false positives," protecting system stability.

📋 FinOps & Business Impact
Every automated intervention is logged with a projected ROI of $50/incident (based on industry averages for engineering time saved). This demonstrates a direct link between Technical Reliability and Business Profitability.
